#### 4th International Workshop on Quality-Aware DevOps (QUDOS 2018)

DevOps has emerged in recent years as a set of principles and practices for smoothing out the gap between development and operations, thus enabling faster release cycles for complex IT services. Common tools and methods used in DevOps include infrastructure as code, continuous deployment, automated testing, continuous integration, and new architectural styles such as microservices.  As of today, software engineering research has mainly explored these problems from a functional perspective, trying to increase the benefits and generality of these methods for the end users. However, this has left behind the definition of methods and tools for DevOps to assess, predict, and verify quality dimensions.

The QUDOS workshop focuses on the problem of how to best define and integrate quality assurance methods and tools in DevOps. Quality covers a broadly-defined set of dimensions including functional correctness, performance, reliability, safety, survivability, and costs, among others. To answer this question, the QUDOS workshop wants to bring together experts from academia and industry working in areas such as quality assurance, testing, performance engineering, agile software engineering, and model-based development. The goal is to identify and disseminate novel quality-aware approaches to DevOps.

QUDOS 2017 is technically sponsored by the Research Group (RG) and the [RG DevOps Performance Working Group](https://research.spec.org/working-groups/devops-performance-working-group.html) of the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC RG)](http://research.spec.org/), and by the consortium of the [EU project DICE](http://dice-h2020.eu/). The workshop is supported by the [Associazione Italiana per l'Informatica e il Calcolo Automatico (AICA)](http://www.aicanet.it/),  the [IFIP Working Group on Service Oriented Systems](http://ifip-wg-sos.deib.polimi.it/), and by the [DFG Priority Programme 1593 (SPP1593) "Design For Future - Managed Software Evolution"](http://www.dfg-spp1593.de/), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
