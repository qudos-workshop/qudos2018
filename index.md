#### 4th International Workshop on Quality-Aware DevOps (QUDOS 2018)

QUDOS 2018 will be held on April 9 or 10, 2018 in Berlin, Germany and will be co-located with the [9th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2018)](https://icpe2018.spec.org/).

The QUDOS workshop provides a forum for experts from academia and industry to present and discuss novel quality-aware methods, practices and tools for DevOps.

DevOps extends the agile development principles to include the full stack of software services, from design to execution, enabling and promoting collaboration of operations, quality assurance, and development engineers throughout the entire service lifecycle. Ultimately, DevOps is a process that enables faster releases of a better product to the end user. DevOps encompasses a set of values, principles, methods, practices, and tools, to accelerate software delivery to the customer by means of infrastructure as code, continuous integration and deployment, automated testing and monitoring, or new architectural styles such as microservices.

Software engineering research mainly deals with the development aspects of DevOps, focusing on development methods, practices, and tools, leaving the quality assurance aspects of DevOps behind. Even though development practices such as testing (at all levels) are instrumental in producing quality software, they mostly deal with the functional correctness, while quality assurance deals with a more broadly defined concept of quality, of which functional correctness is just one dimension. However, DevOps needs methods and tools that enable systematic assessment, prediction, and management of software quality in other dimensions as well, including performance, reliability, safety, survivability, or cost of ownership.

The QUDOS workshop aims to provide a venue for advances in the state of the art in DevOps quality assurance methods, practices, and tools. To this end, the workshop brings together experts from both academia and industry, working in diverse areas such as quality assurance, testing, performance engineering, agile software engineering, and model-based development, with the goal to identify, define, and disseminate novel quality-aware approaches to DevOps.

QUDOS 2018 is technically sponsored by the Research Group (RG) and the [RG DevOps Performance Working Group](https://research.spec.org/working-groups/devops-performance-working-group.html) of the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC RG)](http://research.spec.org/), and by the consortium of the [EU project DICE](http://dice-h2020.eu/). The workshop is supported by the [IFIP Working Group on Service Oriented Systems](http://ifip-wg-sos.deib.polimi.it/), and by the [DFG Priority Programme 1593 (SPP1593) "Design For Future - Managed Software Evolution"](http://www.dfg-spp1593.de/), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
